# Parkinson's Disease Detection Using Voice Analysis

A machine learning project that uses acoustic features from voice recordings to detect Parkinson's disease with high accuracy. This non-invasive approach leverages speech patterns and voice characteristics that are commonly affected in Parkinson's patients.

## Project Overview

Parkinson's disease affects speech and voice production, causing distinctive acoustic changes that can be measured and analyzed. This project implements various machine learning algorithms to classify voice samples as either healthy or indicative of Parkinson's disease.
